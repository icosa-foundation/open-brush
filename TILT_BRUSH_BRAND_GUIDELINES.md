# Tilt Brush Brand Guidelines

The Tilt Brush trademark and logo (“Tilt Brush Trademarks”) are trademarks of Google, and are
treated separately from the copyright or patent license grants contained in the Apache-licensed Tilt
Brush repositories on GitHub. Any use of the Tilt Brush Trademarks other than those permitted in
these guidelines must be approved in advance. 

## Purpose of the Brand Guidelines

These guidelines exist to ensure that the Tilt Brush project can share its technology under open
source licenses while making sure that the “Tilt Brush” brand is protected as a meaningful source
identifier in a way that’s consistent with trademark law. By adhering to these guidelines, you help
to promote the freedom to use and develop high-quality Tilt Brush technology.

## Acceptable Uses

Because we are open-sourcing the Tilt Brush technology, you may use the Tilt Brush trademark to
refer to the project without prior written permission. Examples of these approved references include
the following:

* To refer to the Tilt Brush project itself;
* To refer to unmodified source code or other files shared by the Tilt Brush repositories on GitHub;
* To accurately identify that your design or implementation is based on, is for use with, or is
compatible with the Tilt Brush technology. 

Examples: 
* “[Your Product] for Tilt Brush.”
* “[Your Product] made from Tilt Brush.”
* “[Your Product] is a fork of the Tilt Brush project.”
* “[Your Product] is based on the Tilt Brush technology.”

# Usage Guidelines

* The Tilt Brush name may never be used or registered in a manner that would cause confusion as to
  Google’s sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement.
* Don’t use the Tilt Brush name, or a confusingly similar term, as part of your company name,
  product name, domain name, or social media profile.
* Other than as permitted by these guidelines, the Tilt Brush name should not be combined with other
  trademarks, terms, or source identifiers.
* Don't remove, distort or alter any element of the Tilt Brush Trademarks. That includes modifying
  the Tilt Brush trademark, for example, through hyphenation, combination, or abbreviation. Do not
  shorten, abbreviate, remove the space from, or create acronyms out of the Tilt Brush trademark.
* Don’t display the Tilt Brush name using any different stylization, color, or font from the
  surrounding text.
* Don’t use the term Tilt Brush as a verb, or use it in possessive form.
* Don’t use the Tilt Brush logo on any website, product UI, or promotional materials without our
  prior written permission.
