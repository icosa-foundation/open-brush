SETTING-UP THE PROJECT:

Built-in RP:
1. Install the Post Processing package from the Package Manager
2. Set the Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)

URP:
1. Set the Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)
2. Go to the "URP Shaders" folder and unpack a URP package, depending on your editor version
3. Set the "AN_UniversalRenderPipelineAsset" as default or keep your own (Edit > Project Setiings > Graphics > Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings)


IMPORTANT:

It is recommended to delete the "URP Shaders" folder before updating the asset to avoid mixing old and new shader packages.
