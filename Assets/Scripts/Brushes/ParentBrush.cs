    /*
      Design questions raised:

      - How should strokes be saved?
        1. Save one stroke, with the control points of the parent-most stroke.
           At load time, reconstruct the entire tree of strokes.
        2. "Bake" out all strokes with geometry; ignore parent strokes.
           At load time this looks like a normal sketch.

        Tradeoffs:
        #1 makes sketches more fragile; more logic is run at load time, and if that
        logic changes, the sketch changes. Also, #1 requires a hacked Tilt Brush to
        load. #2 can be loaded by a regular build.

      - How should #1 be implemented? We currently assume one stroke <-> one batch.
        Generalize it to one stroke <-> many batches?

        When line is ended, currently Pointer is in charge of finalization, then
        it passes the line (and maybe subset) to SketchMemory.
        Instead, pass the line only to SketchMemory, and have it do the finalization
        (if necessary) and saving of the strokes.

      - How should #2 be implemented?
        We'd have to remove control-point storage out of PointerScript (a good idea anyway).
        Then we could call MemorizeBrushStroke on each of the strokes in the tree.
