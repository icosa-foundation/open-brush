11.	GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER

11.1.	Governing Law; Alternative Dispute Resolution.  This License shall be
governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to
conflict of laws provisions or principles thereof. The parties agree that,
except as provided below, all disputes relating to this License shall be
resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration before a single neutral
arbitrator in San Mateo, California. The arbitration will be conducted in the
English language by a single arbitrator who is an attorney-at-law with at least
fifteen (15) years’ experience in consumer and technology transactions and who
is also a member of the JAMS roster of arbitrators. If you and Oculus cannot
agree on a mutually acceptable arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the
arbitration is initiated, then JAMS will pick a neutral arbitrator who meets
such qualifications. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules and procedures of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator
shall be final and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together
with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration
and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not
otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be
required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to
enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other
judicial authority. You and Oculus agree the following may be submitted to a
court of competent jurisdiction located within San Francisco, California and
further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located
within San Francisco, California in connection with (a) any entrance of an
arbitrator's judgment or decision, (b) any dispute with respect to the
arbitration process or procedure, (c) Oculus’ exercise of any of its equitable
rights or remedies or (d) any claims regarding the ownership, validity,
enforceability and/or infringement of any intellectual property rights.

11.2.	Class Action/Jury Waiver.  WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE UTILITIES SDK FOR PERSONAL,
COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS
WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S
CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS LICENSE, YOU AND OCULUS ARE EACH
WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,
COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

11.3.	License Suspension. If you file a suit or initiate a proceeding with or
before a governmental authority in which you challenge Oculus’ ownership of any
intellectual property rights related to the Utilities SDK or the validity or
enforceability of any such intellectual property rights (a “Claim”), the
licenses granted to you under this License shall automatically and immediately
(upon the filing of such suit or proceeding) be suspended. Such suspension will
continue until all such Claims asserted by you are dismissed, withdrawn or are
finally settled and no longer pending, as applicable, in which case, such
licenses will be automatically reinstated; provided, however, that such
reinstatement will not release you from any liabilities, or remedies therefor,
that arise during the period of such suspension.

acceptance of the Updated License Terms. If there are Updated License Terms for
any future release of the Utilities SDK, you: (a) agree to comply with all terms
and conditions of such Updated License Terms for such future Utilities SDK

written consent of Oculus will be null and void. Oculus may assign this License
or any licenses or rights granted under this License or delegate any obligations
under this License in its sole discretion, in each case, without your consent or
any notice to you. This License shall be binding on, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by the parties and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns.

12.7.	Severability. In the event that any provision of this License is held to
be null, void, invalid or unenforceable by a court, other governmental body or
arbitration tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, you and Oculus
agree (a) such provision will be modified to the extent necessary to allow it to
be valid and enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law, provided
that such modification reflects as nearly as possible the intentions of the
parties when entering into this License and (b) the remaining provisions of this
License shall remain in full force and effect.

12.8.	Headings. The section headings contained in this License are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this License.

12.9.	No Waiver. Failure of either party at any time to exercise or enforce any
legal right or remedy under this License will not be construed as a waiver of
such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or any portion
of this License. No waiver of any provision of this License shall be of any
force or effect unless set forth in a writing signed by an authorized
representative of each party.
